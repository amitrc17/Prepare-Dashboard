# Prepare-Dashboard
[USE-MI] Node-Js dashboard for clinician or researcher

To run 
  ```
  $ npm install
  $ npm start
  ```
If it works, it should start up the server on `localhost:3000/`, try and hit the index page, it should give you the list of patients. Note that you must have the [data-server](https://github.com/AnirudhaDesai/Pill-Action-Recognition) up and running to be able to make the dashboard work.
